Description: coRPysprofiling is an open-source library designed to bring exploratory 
    data analysis and visualization to the domain of natural language processing. 
    Functions in the package will be used to provide some elementary statistics and 
    visualizations for a single text corpus or provide functions to compare multiple 
    corpora with each other.
